 *
 * An API for storing data using the Abstract Syntax Notation Number One
 * format using DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) encoding. This encoding is
 * commonly used to store data for PKI, i.e. X.509 Certificates, and this
 * implementation exists for that purpose.
 *
 * Abstract Syntax Notation Number One (ASN.1) is used to define the abstract
 * syntax of information without restricting the way the information is encoded
 * for transmission. It provides a standard that allows for open systems
 * communication. ASN.1 defines the syntax of information data and a number of
 * simple data types as well as a notation for describing them and specifying
 * values for them.
 *
 * The RSA algorithm creates public and private keys that are often stored in
 * X.509 or PKCS#X formats -- which use ASN.1 (encoded in DER format). This
 * class provides the most basic functionality required to store and load DSA
 * keys that are encoded according to ASN.1.
 *
 * The most common binary encodings for ASN.1 are BER (Basic Encoding Rules)
 * and DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules). DER is just a subset of BER that
 * has stricter requirements for how data must be encoded.
 *
 * Each ASN.1 structure has a tag (a byte identifying the ASN.1 structure type)
 * and a byte array for the value of this ASN1 structure which may be data or a
 * list of ASN.1 structures.
 *
 * Each ASN.1 structure using BER is (Tag-Length-Value):
 *
 * | byte 0 | bytes X | bytes Y |
 * |--------|---------|----------
 * |  tag   | length  |  value  |
 *
 * ASN.1 allows for tags to be of "High-tag-number form" which allows a tag to
 * be two or more octets, but that is not supported by this class. A tag is
 * only 1 byte. Bits 1-5 give the tag number (ie the data type within a
 * particular 'class'), 6 indicates whether or not the ASN.1 value is
 * constructed from other ASN.1 values, and bits 7 and 8 give the 'class'. If
 * bits 7 and 8 are both zero, the class is UNIVERSAL. If only bit 7 is set,
 * then the class is APPLICATION. If only bit 8 is set, then the class is
 * CONTEXT_SPECIFIC. If both bits 7 and 8 are set, then the class is PRIVATE.
 * The tag numbers for the data types for the class UNIVERSAL are listed below:
 *
 * UNIVERSAL 0 Reserved for use by the encoding rules
 * UNIVERSAL 1 Boolean type
 * UNIVERSAL 2 Integer type
 * UNIVERSAL 3 Bitstring type
 * UNIVERSAL 4 Octetstring type
 * UNIVERSAL 5 Null type
 * UNIVERSAL 6 Object identifier type
 * UNIVERSAL 7 Object descriptor type
 * UNIVERSAL 8 External type and Instance-of type
 * UNIVERSAL 9 Real type
 * UNIVERSAL 10 Enumerated type
 * UNIVERSAL 11 Embedded-pdv type
 * UNIVERSAL 12 UTF8String type
 * UNIVERSAL 13 Relative object identifier type
 * UNIVERSAL 14-15 Reserved for future editions
 * UNIVERSAL 16 Sequence and Sequence-of types
 * UNIVERSAL 17 Set and Set-of types
 * UNIVERSAL 18-22, 25-30 Character string types
 * UNIVERSAL 23-24 Time types
 *
 * The length of an ASN.1 structure is specified after the tag identifier.
 * There is a definite form and an indefinite form. The indefinite form may
 * be used if the encoding is constructed and not all immediately available.
 * The indefinite form is encoded using a length byte with only the 8th bit
 * set. The end of the constructed object is marked using end-of-contents
 * octets (two zero bytes).
 *
 * The definite form looks like this:
 *
 * The length may take up 1 or more bytes, it depends on the length of the
 * value of the ASN.1 structure. DER encoding requires that if the ASN.1
 * structure has a value that has a length greater than 127, more than 1 byte
 * will be used to store its length, otherwise just one byte will be used.
 * This is strict.
 *
 * In the case that the length of the ASN.1 value is less than 127, 1 octet
 * (byte) is used to store the "short form" length. The 8th bit has a value of
 * 0 indicating the length is "short form" and not "long form" and bits 7-1
 * give the length of the data. (The 8th bit is the left-most, most significant
 * bit: also known as big endian or network format).
 *
 * In the case that the length of the ASN.1 value is greater than 127, 2 to
 * 127 octets (bytes) are used to store the "long form" length. The first
 * byte's 8th bit is set to 1 to indicate the length is "long form." Bits 7-1
 * give the number of additional octets. All following octets are in base 256
 * with the most significant digit first (typical big-endian binary unsigned
 * integer storage). So, for instance, if the length of a value was 257, the
 * first byte would be set to:
 *
 * 10000010 = 130 = 0x82.
 *
 * This indicates there are 2 octets (base 256) for the length. The second and
 * third bytes (the octets just mentioned) would store the length in base 256:
 *
 * octet 2: 00000001 = 1 * 256^1 = 256
 * octet 3: 00000001 = 1 * 256^0 = 1
 * total = 257
 *
 * The algorithm for converting a js integer value of 257 to base-256 is:
 *
 * var value = 257;
 * var bytes = [];
 * bytes[0] = (value >>> 8) & 0xFF; // most significant byte first
 * bytes[1] = value & 0xFF;        // least significant byte last
 *
 * On the ASN.1 UNIVERSAL Object Identifier (OID) type:
 *
 * An OID can be written like: "value1.value2.value3...valueN"
 *
 * The DER encoding rules:
 *
 * The first byte has the value 40 * value1 + value2.
 * The following bytes, if any, encode the remaining values. Each value is
 * encoded in base 128, most significant digit first (big endian), with as
 * few digits as possible, and the most significant bit of each byte set
 * to 1 except the last in each value's encoding. For example: Given the
 * OID "1.2.840.113549", its DER encoding is (remember each byte except the
 * last one in each encoding is OR'd with 0x80):
 *
 * byte 1: 40 * 1 + 2 = 42 = 0x2A.
 * bytes 2-3: 128 * 6 + 72 = 840 = 6 72 = 6 72 = 0x0648 = 0x8648
 * bytes 4-6: 16384 * 6 + 128 * 119 + 13 = 6 119 13 = 0x06770D = 0x86F70D
 *
 * The final value is: 0x2A864886F70D.
 * The full OID (including ASN.1 tag and length of 6 bytes) is:
 * 0x06062A864886F70D
